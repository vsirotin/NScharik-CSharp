NScharik is a C# library for validating user input in ASP.NET applications.
The validation of user input in Web applications for several reasons
extreme important. Unfortunately, this task often by developers and management is strong
underestimated. The receipt for it will come later, during operation of the application, in the form of
evil form attacks or difficult to understand human error.
The board means of ASP.NET is sufficient for the development of web applications
demanding validation not.
NScharik was one of the first free validation framework that closes this gap.
Unfortunately, currently there is only documentation in German :-(
